;;; init.el --- Personal Emacs configuration -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;;; Commentary:
;; Entry point for my Emacs setup.
;; Loads custom Lisp modules, applies performance tweaks, and sets up packages.

;;; Code:

;; Load Path Setup
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory))
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lisp/packages" user-emacs-directory))

;; Performance Tweaks
;; Increase garbage collection threshold to reduce GC pauses during heavy ops.
(setq gc-cons-threshold #x40000000)

;; Increase process output read size (default is 4KB, bump to 4MB).
(setq read-process-output-max (* 4 1024 1024))

;; reset GC threshold after startup for balance
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
